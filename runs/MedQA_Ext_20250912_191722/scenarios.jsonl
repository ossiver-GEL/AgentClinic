It seems to be more about the sharp pain rather than any weakness.\n\nAny back trauma, osteoporosis, chronic steroid use, or age over 50?\n\nI haven't had any back trauma or been diagnosed with osteoporosis. I've never used steroids and I'm only 26 years old.\n\nAny saddle anesthesia or numbness around the groin?\n\nNo, I haven't experienced any saddle anesthesia or numbness around my groin at all. The pain is concentrated in my lower back and radiates down my right leg.\n\nHave you tried a straight-leg raise at home, and does lifting the right leg while lying flat reproduce the shooting pain down the leg?\n\nI haven't tried the straight-leg raise at home yet, but I suspect it might hurt since lifting my leg usually increases the discomfort. I'm worried about how to relieve this pain.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Straight_Leg_Raise_Right\n\nRESULTS: Positive straight leg raise test with pain radiating down the leg.\n\nDo you have any pain or tingling along the outer shin and top of the foot, and is your knee reflex normal?\n\nI do feel some tingling along the top of my foot, but not really along the outer shin. I'm not sure about my knee reflex, but it feels normal to me.\n\nDo you have increased pain with coughing or sneezing?\n\nYes, I do notice that coughing or sneezing makes the pain feel sharper and worse. It’s quite uncomfortable.\n\nDoes pain or tingling involve the first web space between the big toe and second toe?\n\nI don't feel any pain or tingling between my big toe and second toe; the tingling is more focused on the top of my foot. The sharp pain mainly stays in my lower back and radiates down my leg.\n\nAny weakness with ankle eversion or numbness on the outer foot?\n\nI haven't noticed any weakness with ankle eversion, and I don't feel any numbness on the outer foot either. The pain is primarily in my lower back and radiates down my leg.\n\nAny groin (hip flexor) weakness or reduced knee-jerk on the right?\n\nI haven't noticed any weakness in my groin or hip flexor, and my knee-jerk reflex seems normal. The sharp pain is really distracting, though.\n\nAny foot dorsiflexion or great toe extension weakness on the right?\n\nI haven't noticed any weakness when trying to lift my foot or my big toe. The pain is still my main concern, especially when I move.\n\nAny numbness or pain in the lateral thigh and calf with a reduced ankle (Achilles) reflex?\n\nNo, I don't have any numbness or pain in my lateral thigh or calf.

My symptoms have been pretty consistent without any significant changes.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Brain_MRI_with_and_without_contrast\n\nRESULTS: **Vital Signs:** - Temperature: 37.0°C (98.6°F) - Blood Pressure: - Sitting: 130/80 mmHg - Standing: 110/65 mmHg - Heart Rate: 70 bpm - Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths/min **Neurological Examination:** - Mental Status: Oriented to person and place, not time - Cranial Nerves: Speech slurred but cranial nerves grossly intact - Motor: - Strength: Normal strength but with rigidity in upper and lower extremities - Coordination: Unable to perform repetitive forearm movements - Tremor: Mild tremor in right hand - Sensory: No noted deficits - Reflexes: Normal - Gait: Unable to assess due to inability to walk unassisted **Tests:** - **Complete Blood Count:** - WBC: 7,000 /μL - Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL - Platelets: 300,000 /μL - **Urinalysis:** - Appearance: Clear - WBC: 0-5 /HPF - RBC\n\nREQUEST TEST: Brain_MRI_with_and_without_contrast\n\nRESULTS: **MRI Brain and Spinal Cord:** Findings: Multiple areas of atrophy and signal changes in the brainstem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, consistent with neurodegenerative processes.\n\nI do experience some dizziness when standing, but I haven’t had any significant drops in blood pressure, and I don’t require catheterization for urinary retention. My urinary incontinence has been a concern, but it's more about loss of control rather than retention.\n\nI have noticed some difficulty with coordination, especially with repetitive movements. My gait feels unsteady, but it's more of a shuffling rather than wide-based. Rapid alternating movements are challenging for me as well.\n\nI haven't experienced erectile dysfunction, and I don't really have any issues with constipation. Abnormal sweating hasn’t been a problem for me either; my sweating seems pretty normal.\n\nI haven’t had any difficulty controlling my eye movements, and I haven’t experienced double vision either. My vision seems to be stable.\n\nI haven't had any new-onset erectile dysfunction, and my libido seems to be pretty normal as well. It's really just the other symptoms that have been more concerning for me.\n\nMy symptoms have gradually worsened over the past few months, rather than progressing rapidly. I definitely feel unstable when I try to turn or initiate my walk; it often feels like I might fall if I’m not careful.\n\nYes, I do experience urinary urgency with leakage, even after I feel like I've emptied my bladder. It can be quite bothersome and adds to my overall discomfort.\n\n", "llm_responses_config": {"max_output_tokens": 256, "reasoning": {"effort": "minimal"}, "text": {"verbosity": "low"}}, "llm_runtime_config": {"tries": 30, "timeout": 2.0, "clip_prompt": false, "max_prompt_len": 16384}}

Sweating also seems to aggravate it quite a bit.\n\nDoes anything relieve it (thick moisturizers, topical steroids), and have you tried any treatments?\n\nI've tried using thick moisturizers, and they help a little, but I haven't used any topical steroids yet.

The rash just appears as dry, scaly patches without that specific pattern.\n\nHave you had significant sun exposure on those areas, and does the rash worsen after sun?\n\nI do spend some time outside, especially when going to class, and I’ve noticed that the rash can get worse after being in the sun. It tends to become redder and itchier when that happens.\n\nDo you notice dandruff or a scaly, itchy scalp?\n\nI haven't noticed any dandruff or an itchy scalp.

It usually settles down after a little while, but it can be uncomfortable.\n\nHave you started any photosensitizing meds or supplements recently (e.g., doxycycline, isotretinoin, thiazides, NSAIDs, St. John’s wort)?\n\nI haven't started any new medications or supplements recently, and I'm not taking any that I know could cause photosensitivity.

Lately, though, I can't seem to hear them anymore, especially with this weather. It’s frustrating because I genuinely believe I should be able to communicate with them.\n\nWhen did these beliefs start, and have they changed recently?\n\nIt all started about eight months ago. At first, I felt a strong connection, but recently, it feels like I've lost that ability, especially with the changing weather. It’s disheartening.\n\nHave you noticed hearing voices, seeing things others don’t, or believing others can read your thoughts?\n\nI haven’t heard voices or seen anything unusual, but I do feel like I can sense what animals are feeling. It just seems to be fading. I don’t think others can read my thoughts, though.\n\nHave these beliefs caused problems at work, school, relationships, or daily functioning?\n\nI haven’t lost my job, but my coworkers think it’s odd. It does make it hard to connect with people since I focus so much on trying to communicate with animals instead.\n\nHave you had mood changes, decreased need for sleep, high energy, or periods of depression?\n\nI haven't had mood changes, but I find myself feeling more isolated lately. My energy levels are normal, but sometimes I just feel a deep sense of disappointment about not being able to connect with animals like I used to.\n\nHave you used substances (cannabis, psychedelics, stimulants), or started/stopped any medications or supplements in the past year?\n\nI haven’t used any substances like that. I’ve only been taking assorted Peruvian herbs, hoping they’d help, but they haven’t made a difference.

I wish more people understood it, as sometimes I sense they find it strange or threatening. It makes it hard to share my beliefs openly.\n\nHave you had paranoia, disorganized speech/behavior, or difficulty with self-care recently?\n\nI wouldn’t say I’m paranoid, but I do feel misunderstood. My thoughts can get jumbled when I try to explain myself, especially about animals. Self-care has been fine, but sometimes I get so focused on connecting with them that I neglect other things.\n\nHave you had any recent stressors, sleep changes, or medical symptoms like weight loss, fevers, or thyroid issues?\n\nI haven't noticed any weight loss or fevers. My sleep has been normal, but I do feel a bit more stressed with everything. It feels like I’m carrying this burden of trying to reconnect with animals.\n\nHave you used caffeine, nicotine, or alcohol more lately, or had any legal or social consequences from your beliefs?\n\nI haven't used caffeine or nicotine recently, and I don't drink alcohol. My beliefs haven't caused any legal issues, but I do feel like I’m socially isolated because of how others perceive my thoughts about animals.\n\nHave you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or others, or felt compelled to act on messages from animals?\n\nI haven't had thoughts of harming myself or others. I just really wish I could reconnect with the animals; it feels more like a longing than anything harmful. I sometimes feel compelled to act on their feelings, but it's always been positive.\n\nHave these beliefs caused you to fully believe they’re true despite others’ disbelief, or do you think they might be unusual or symbolic?\n\nI truly believe that my connection with animals is real, not just symbolic. Even when others express doubt, it feels very genuine to me.

My focus shifts, and I feel a pull towards them, which makes daily tasks a bit challenging.\n\nHave you ever had similar beliefs or unusual experiences in your family, or a family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder?\n\nI don't know of any similar beliefs in my family. As far as I’m aware, there isn’t a family history of psychosis or bipolar disorder either. My family has always been pretty supportive of my connection to nature and animals.\n\nHave you experienced significant anxiety, OCD-like rituals, or autism spectrum traits since childhood?\n\nI wouldn't say I've had significant anxiety or OCD rituals. I've always felt a bit different, but not to the point of being on the autism spectrum. It's more about my connection to nature and animals rather than any specific traits.\n\nHave you had any medical evaluations (thyroid, B12, infections) or neurological symptoms like headaches, vision changes, or seizures?\n\nI haven’t had any medical evaluations lately, and I don't have headaches, vision changes, or seizures.

I really try to pay attention, but my mind wanders when it's not interesting.\"\n\nDo you have behavior issues or zoning out during fun activities too, or mainly with boring/unenjoyable tasks?\n\n\"Mostly just with boring or unenjoyable tasks. When I'm doing something fun, I'm focused and really into it.\"\n\nDo you have any rule-breaking, arguing, or spiteful behavior at home lasting 6+ months?\n\n\"I don't really argue or break rules at home. I usually help out and get along with my family.\"\n\nDo teachers note inattention and fidgeting most days for 6+ months, or is it just since this school year?\n\n\"It’s mostly just been this school year.

The behavior issues started recently, especially this school year.\"\n\nHave there been any changes or stressors recently (family, school, sleep, screens)?\n\n\"I don't think so. Things are pretty normal at home and school. I still get my sleep and play my games.\"\n\nHave teachers or parents noticed inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, or aggression—what behaviors are happening?\n\n\"Yeah, my teacher says I can be disruptive and sometimes I don't want to follow instructions. I don't think I'm aggressive, though.\"\n\nAre you having trouble focusing, fidgeting a lot, or acting without thinking both at school and at home?\n\n\"I don't really have trouble focusing on things I like, but I do fidget sometimes. At home, I usually think before I act, but at school, it’s different.\"\n\nDo these behaviors cause problems with grades, friends, or getting in trouble at school?\n\n\"Sometimes it gets me in trouble at school, but my grades are still good when I try. My friends seem to like me just fine.\"\n\nAre there any symptoms like sadness, anxiety, irritability, or trouble sleeping lately?\n\n\"I don't feel sad or anxious, and I sleep fine.

My teacher is the same, and I haven't seen any bullying.\"\n\nHave you ever had problems with attention or behavior in earlier grades, or is this the first time?\n\n\"This is the first time I've had problems like this. Before this year, I wasn't disruptive at all.\"\n\nHave there been any recent illnesses, head injuries, new medications, or changes in caffeine/energy drink use?\n\n\"I haven't had any illnesses or head injuries. I don’t take any medications, and I don't drink energy drinks or caffeine.\"\n\nHave there been any learning difficulties (reading, writing, math) or teacher reports of specific triggers for the disruptions?\n\n\"I haven't had any learning difficulties. I do well in reading and math when I want to. I think my disruptions happen when I feel bored or when I don't want to do something.\"\n\nWhat consequences happen at school when you refuse tasks, and do you argue or deliberately annoy the teacher?\n\n\"If I refuse to do tasks, sometimes I get a warning or have to sit out for a bit. I don't really argue, but I guess I can be a bit annoying if I don't want to do something.\"\n\nDo you lose your temper, blame others, or deliberately break rules at home or school?\n\n\"I don't usually lose my temper or blame others.

My parents haven't mentioned anything like that.\n\nI mainly have stridor on inspiration, especially when I'm crying or feeding. It can also happen a bit with expiration, but it's mostly during inhalation.\n\nI haven't had any episodes of apnea or pauses in breathing during sleep, and I've never turned blue while sleeping either.\n\nIt can get worse when I'm excited or agitated, but it usually improves when I calm down.\n\nYes, the stridor does sound high-pitched and squeaky. It’s definitely worse when I’m feeding or crying, but it gets better when I’m in a prone position or if my neck is extended.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Flexible_Laryngoscopy\n\nRESULTS: NORMAL READINGS\n\nI haven't had any biphasic stridor or barking cough episodes. It's mainly been high-pitched stridor during inhalation, especially with feeding or crying.\n\nI haven’t had any swallowing difficulties with solid foods, and I don't get respiratory infections often. I mostly feel fine aside from the stridor and wheezing episodes.\n\nI don't have any history of neck or chest masses. I do notice that the noisy breathing gets worse when my neck is flexed and improves when it's extended.\n\n", "llm_responses_config": {"max_output_tokens": 256, "reasoning": {"effort": "minimal"}, "text": {"verbosity": "low"}}, "llm_runtime_config": {"tries": 30, "timeout": 2.0, "clip_prompt": false, "max_prompt_len": 16384}}

It’s like this heavy weight that just doesn’t go away.\n\nHave you lost interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy?\n\nI used to enjoy going out with friends and painting, but now I hardly feel motivated to do anything at all. It just feels empty and draining.\n\nHave you had thoughts of death or harming yourself?\n\nI haven’t really thought about harming myself, but sometimes I feel like life isn’t worth living. It’s hard to shake off those thoughts, especially when the voices tell me I’m worthless.\n\nHave you ever had periods of unusually elevated or irritable mood with decreased need for sleep?\n\nI haven't experienced any periods of elevated or irritable mood. It's mostly just been this persistent sadness and low energy.\n\nHave the voices been present daily for at least 2 weeks, and do they occur even when your mood is not worse?\n\nYes, the voices are pretty much always there, even on days when I don't feel as low. They just seem to linger in the background, reminding me of all the negative things. It's exhausting.\n\nDo the voices comment on your actions or give you commands, and do you believe they are real?\n\nThe voices primarily mock me and tell me I'm worthless. I don't think they're real, but sometimes they feel so vivid that it's hard to shake them off. It's like they're just a part of my reality now.\n\nDo you use alcohol or drugs, or have any medical conditions or medications?\n\nI don’t use alcohol or drugs, and I don't have any significant medical conditions or take any medications. It's really just been this emotional struggle that I've been dealing with.\n\nHave you noticed delusions (firm false beliefs) or disorganized thinking/speech?\n\nI haven't noticed any firm false beliefs or disorganized thinking, but sometimes my thoughts feel jumbled, and it's hard to focus. It’s like my mind is in a fog, making it difficult to articulate what I want to say.\n\nHave these symptoms caused significant problems in work, social life, or self-care?\n\nYes, definitely. My work performance has plummeted because I can't concentrate, and I've been avoiding social outings. Simple self-care tasks feel overwhelming, so I've been neglecting them too.\n\nHave you ever had a similar episode before, and does anyone in your family have mood or psychotic disorders?\n\nI haven’t experienced anything like this before. As for my family, there’s a history of anxiety and depression, but no one has had any major mood or psychotic disorders that I know of.\n\nHave you had changes in sleep or appetite (too little or too much)?\n\nI've definitely had changes in both sleep and appetite. I've been sleeping very little, and I just don’t feel hungry most of the time. Eating feels like a chore.\n\nHave you noticed your movements being slowed down or agitated, or felt excessive guilt?\n\nI haven't noticed any excessive guilt, but I do feel like my movements can be slower sometimes. I can be restless too, like I can’t sit still, but it's more of a mental agitation rather than physical.\n\nHave you had any recent medical workup (thyroid tests, B12, CBC), head injury, seizures, or neurological symptoms like headaches or vision changes?\n\nI haven’t had any recent medical workups or tests.

The voices only come when I'm feeling really low or during this prolonged sadness.\n\nHave the voices lasted at least 2 weeks continuously during this depressive episode?\n\nYes, the voices have been there continuously throughout this depressive episode, almost like a dark shadow. They don't really go away, even on days when I feel a bit better.\n\nDo you ever feel the voices are telling you to harm yourself or others?\n\nNo, they don’t tell me to harm myself or anyone else. They mainly just mock and criticize me, making it harder to feel good about anything. It's more about reminding me of my worthlessness than suggesting any harmful actions.\n\nDo you have any significant anxiety, panic attacks, or obsessive worries alongside the depression?\n\nI do feel anxious at times, especially when I think about work or social situations. It’s like this constant knot in my stomach, but I haven’t experienced any full-blown panic attacks.

I can't sit still and find myself fidgeting a lot, like I'm always moving my legs or pacing around.\n\nHow soon after starting or changing any psychiatric medication did these movements begin?\n\nThey started a few weeks after I began taking risperidone. It’s like this constant need to move; it’s pretty uncomfortable.\n\nHave the movements improved or worsened with dose increases or when you miss a dose?\n\nI've noticed that they tend to get worse when I miss a dose. Increasing the medication doesn't seem to improve it either; I still feel that restlessness.\n\nDo you also feel an internal sense of anxiety or inner restlessness that eases briefly when you move?\n\nYes, that's exactly it. I feel this intense restlessness that only seems to ease when I'm moving, but it always comes back. It's like I can't find a comfortable position to relax.\n\nDo you have any muscle stiffness, fever, confusion, or autonomic symptoms like sweating or rapid heartbeat?\n\nI don’t have any muscle stiffness, fever, or confusion. My heartbeat feels normal, but I do sometimes get a bit sweaty.\n\nDo the movements lessen when you’re distracted or asleep?\n\nWhen I'm distracted, they can sometimes feel a bit less intense, but they don’t completely go away. I can't sleep well because the restlessness keeps me tossing and turning.\n\nDo you have any other abnormal movements like tongue darting, lip smacking, or facial grimacing?\n\nNo, I don't experience any of those movements like tongue darting or lip smacking. It's really just that overwhelming restlessness and the need to keep moving.\n\nAny changes in mood, suicidality, or worsening anxiety since the restlessness began?\n\nI've been feeling a bit more anxious since the restlessness started, but no thoughts about harming myself. My mood swings have also increased, and sometimes I feel overwhelmed by everything.\n\nHave you tried any remedies like propranolol, benzodiazepines, or anticholinergics, and did they help?\n\nI haven’t tried any of those medications yet. I’m not sure if they would help with the restlessness, but I’d be open to discussing it.\n\nDo the symptoms interfere with daily activities (work, sitting through a meal, watching TV)?\n\nYes, they definitely interfere. It's hard to focus on lectures or even enjoy a meal because I'm always fidgeting or wanting to get up and move around.\n\nDo symptoms ease within minutes after movement, and did they start within weeks of risperidone initiation?\n\nYes, symptoms do ease a bit right after I move, but they always come back pretty quickly. And you're right—they really started a few weeks after I began taking risperidone.\n\nGiven your timing, inner restlessness, and need to move on risperidone, this fits antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Any history of Parkinson’s disease or prior movement disorders?\n\nI don't have any history of Parkinson’s disease or any other movement disorders. This restlessness is really just a recent change since starting the medication.\n\nHave you used any other dopamine-blocking drugs recently (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine)?\n\nI haven’t used any other dopamine-blocking drugs. It’s really just the risperidone that I've been taking.\n\nAny alcohol, caffeine, or stimulant use that worsens the restlessness?\n\nI don’t consume any alcohol or drugs, but I do drink coffee occasionally. I’ve noticed that caffeine seems to make the restlessness a bit worse.\n\nHave you noticed any muscle rigidity or slow movements suggestive of parkinsonism since starting risperidone?\n\nI haven’t noticed any muscle rigidity or slow movements. It really feels more like this constant urge to move rather than any stiffness or slowness.\n\nHave you had any recent dose changes of risperidone or are you on a long-acting injectable?\n\nI haven't had any recent dose changes; I've been on the same dose since starting risperidone. I'm not on a long-acting injectable either.\n\nDo you have restlessness when lying down that improves briefly if you get up and pace?\n\nYes, I definitely feel the restlessness when I'm lying down. It usually improves a bit if I get up and start pacing around, but it always seems to come back. It makes it really hard to settle down at night.\n\nDo you have any abnormal blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, or severe anxiety during episodes?\n\nI haven't noticed any abnormal blood pressure or rapid heartbeat during these episodes, but I do sometimes feel a surge of anxiety. It's like the restlessness triggers a bit of worry, but it settles down once I move.\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Antipsychotic-induced akathisia (risperidone-related)\n\n", "patient_hist": "Can you describe the movements—are they tremors, jerks, writhing, or stiffness?\n\nThey feel more like a restless energy.

Increasing the medication doesn't seem to improve it either; I still feel that restlessness.\n\nDo you also feel an internal sense of anxiety or inner restlessness that eases briefly when you move?\n\nYes, that's exactly it. I feel this intense restlessness that only seems to ease when I'm moving, but it always comes back. It's like I can't find a comfortable position to relax.\n\nDo you have any muscle stiffness, fever, confusion, or autonomic symptoms like sweating or rapid heartbeat?\n\nI don’t have any muscle stiffness, fever, or confusion. My heartbeat feels normal, but I do sometimes get a bit sweaty.\n\nDo the movements lessen when you’re distracted or asleep?\n\nWhen I'm distracted, they can sometimes feel a bit less intense, but they don’t completely go away. I can't sleep well because the restlessness keeps me tossing and turning.\n\nDo you have any other abnormal movements like tongue darting, lip smacking, or facial grimacing?\n\nNo, I don't experience any of those movements like tongue darting or lip smacking. It's really just that overwhelming restlessness and the need to keep moving.\n\nAny changes in mood, suicidality, or worsening anxiety since the restlessness began?\n\nI've been feeling a bit more anxious since the restlessness started, but no thoughts about harming myself. My mood swings have also increased, and sometimes I feel overwhelmed by everything.\n\nHave you tried any remedies like propranolol, benzodiazepines, or anticholinergics, and did they help?\n\nI haven’t tried any of those medications yet. I’m not sure if they would help with the restlessness, but I’d be open to discussing it.\n\nDo the symptoms interfere with daily activities (work, sitting through a meal, watching TV)?\n\nYes, they definitely interfere. It's hard to focus on lectures or even enjoy a meal because I'm always fidgeting or wanting to get up and move around.\n\nDo symptoms ease within minutes after movement, and did they start within weeks of risperidone initiation?\n\nYes, symptoms do ease a bit right after I move, but they always come back pretty quickly. And you're right—they really started a few weeks after I began taking risperidone.\n\nGiven your timing, inner restlessness, and need to move on risperidone, this fits antipsychotic-induced akathisia. Any history of Parkinson’s disease or prior movement disorders?\n\nI don't have any history of Parkinson’s disease or any other movement disorders. This restlessness is really just a recent change since starting the medication.\n\nHave you used any other dopamine-blocking drugs recently (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine)?\n\nI haven’t used any other dopamine-blocking drugs. It’s really just the risperidone that I've been taking.\n\nAny alcohol, caffeine, or stimulant use that worsens the restlessness?\n\nI don’t consume any alcohol or drugs, but I do drink coffee occasionally. I’ve noticed that caffeine seems to make the restlessness a bit worse.\n\nHave you noticed any muscle rigidity or slow movements suggestive of parkinsonism since starting risperidone?\n\nI haven’t noticed any muscle rigidity or slow movements. It really feels more like this constant urge to move rather than any stiffness or slowness.\n\nHave you had any recent dose changes of risperidone or are you on a long-acting injectable?\n\nI haven't had any recent dose changes; I've been on the same dose since starting risperidone. I'm not on a long-acting injectable either.\n\nDo you have restlessness when lying down that improves briefly if you get up and pace?\n\nYes, I definitely feel the restlessness when I'm lying down. It usually improves a bit if I get up and start pacing around, but it always seems to come back. It makes it really hard to settle down at night.\n\nDo you have any abnormal blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, or severe anxiety during episodes?\n\nI haven't noticed any abnormal blood pressure or rapid heartbeat during these episodes, but I do sometimes feel a surge of anxiety. It's like the restlessness triggers a bit of worry, but it settles down once I move.\n\n", "measurement_hist": "They feel more like a restless energy.

I began feeling like someone was watching me and that my thoughts were being controlled. I felt a lot of anxiety and couldn't shake the feeling of being persecuted.\n\nHave you been hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t?\n\nNo, I haven't heard any voices or seen anything unusual. It's mostly this feeling of paranoia and the belief that I'm being monitored. It just feels like everything around me is suspicious.\n\nHave you used alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, or other drugs recently?\n\nI haven't used any drugs or alcohol at all. I've always stayed away from that stuff. It’s just been this overwhelming feeling without any substances influencing me.\n\nHave you had fever, headaches, recent infections, head injury, or seizures?\n\nI haven’t had any fever or headaches recently, and I haven’t experienced any infections, head injuries, or seizures. My physical health has been stable.\n\nHave these beliefs caused problems at work, school, or home, or led to risky behavior?\n\nYes, they definitely caused issues at work. I stopped going in because I felt like my coworkers were in on it, and then I was let go. My wife says I’ve been more withdrawn at home too, which has created tension between us.\n\nHave you had any changes in sleep, appetite, energy, or mood (e.g., depression or mania)?\n\nMy sleep has been really disrupted; I struggle to fall asleep and wake up frequently. My appetite's been off too—I often forget to eat. Sometimes I feel really down, but then I get bursts of agitation.\n\nHave you ever had similar symptoms before, or is this the first episode?\n\nThis feels like the first time I've experienced anything like this. I've never had issues like this in the past, just normal ups and downs. This all came on suddenly and it’s been overwhelming.\n\nHave you had thoughts of harming yourself or others?\n\nNo, I haven't thought about harming myself or anyone else. It’s more about the feeling that I'm being targeted than anything else. I just want to make sense of what's happening to me.\n\nHave you had any disorganized thinking or odd behaviors (e.g., talking to yourself, neglecting hygiene, bizarre actions)?\n\nI've noticed my thoughts are all over the place, and sometimes I find it hard to follow a conversation. I've also been neglecting basic things like showering and keeping my space tidy. It's like I get lost in my own mind.\n\nHave you experienced any clear manic symptoms like needing very little sleep with high energy, grandiosity, or risky impulsive behavior?\n\nNo, I haven’t had any of those manic symptoms like needing little sleep or feeling overly confident. It’s more of a constant feeling of agitation and confusion, rather than highs and lows. I mostly feel drained and overwhelmed by everything.\n\nHave you had any recent weight loss, night sweats, or other medical issues, and are you on any medications or supplements?\n\nI haven't experienced any weight loss or night sweats, and I’m not on any medications or supplements. My physical health seems fine, but the mental strain is really taking a toll on me.\n\nHave you or any family members had psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression?\n\nI don’t have a history of psychiatric conditions in my family that I know of, and I’ve never experienced anything like this myself before. It all feels very unfamiliar and frightening to me.\n\nHave you used any new medications, herbal products, or had exposure to toxins or heavy metals at work or home?\n\nI haven’t used any new medications or herbal products. As for exposure to toxins, I don’t think so. I’ve mostly been at home tinkering with my device and trying to avoid anything that could make me feel worse.\n\nHave you ever had seizures, fainting spells, or episodes of losing time or memory gaps?\n\nNo, I haven’t had any seizures or fainting spells, and I don’t experience memory gaps either. I remember everything clearly; it’s just my thoughts are scattered and confusing.\n\nHave you had any recent major stressors or life changes (job loss, move, conflict, financial strain)?\n\nYes, losing my job was a huge stressor for me. It really pushed me into a spiral of anxiety and paranoia, and I felt like everything spiraled out of control from there. There have also been some financial strains since then, which doesn’t help.\n\nHave you had any thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases, or neurologic problems in the past?\n\nNo, I haven’t had any thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases, or neurologic problems in the past. I’ve been physically healthy, with no significant medical history to report.\n\nHave you noticed catatonic signs like mutism, posturing, or excessive purposeless movement?\n\nI haven't noticed any signs of mutism or posturing, but I do feel like I'm constantly on edge, moving around a lot without a clear purpose. It's like I can't sit still and my mind is racing all the time.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Urine_Toxicology_Screen\n\nRESULTS: Alcohol: Negative, Amphetamines: Negative, Cannabinoids: Negative, Cocaine: Negative, Opiates: Negative\n\nDo you have fixed false beliefs (e.g., being monitored) despite reassurance for over 1 month without hallucinations?\n\nYes, I truly believe that I'm being monitored and that there's something much bigger at play. No matter how much others reassure me, I can't shake that feeling—it just feels so real to me.This is the final question. Please provide a diagnosis.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Delusional Disorder, Persecutory Type\n\n", "patient_hist": "Can you tell me when these symptoms started and what happened right before they began?\n\nIt all started about six weeks ago. I began feeling like someone was watching me and that my thoughts were being controlled. I felt a lot of anxiety and couldn't shake the feeling of being persecuted.\n\nHave you been hearing voices or seeing things that others don’t?\n\nNo, I haven't heard any voices or seen anything unusual. It's mostly this feeling of paranoia and the belief that I'm being monitored. It just feels like everything around me is suspicious.\n\nHave you used alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, or other drugs recently?\n\nI haven't used any drugs or alcohol at all. I've always stayed away from that stuff. It’s just been this overwhelming feeling without any substances influencing me.\n\nHave you had fever, headaches, recent infections, head injury, or seizures?\n\nI haven’t had any fever or headaches recently, and I haven’t experienced any infections, head injuries, or seizures. My physical health has been stable.\n\nHave these beliefs caused problems at work, school, or home, or led to risky behavior?\n\nYes, they definitely caused issues at work. I stopped going in because I felt like my coworkers were in on it, and then I was let go. My wife says I’ve been more withdrawn at home too, which has created tension between us.\n\nHave you had any changes in sleep, appetite, energy, or mood (e.g., depression or mania)?\n\nMy sleep has been really disrupted; I struggle to fall asleep and wake up frequently. My appetite's been off too—I often forget to eat. Sometimes I feel really down, but then I get bursts of agitation.\n\nHave you ever had similar symptoms before, or is this the first episode?\n\nThis feels like the first time I've experienced anything like this. I've never had issues like this in the past, just normal ups and downs. This all came on suddenly and it’s been overwhelming.\n\nHave you had thoughts of harming yourself or others?\n\nNo, I haven't thought about harming myself or anyone else. It’s more about the feeling that I'm being targeted than anything else. I just want to make sense of what's happening to me.\n\nHave you had any disorganized thinking or odd behaviors (e.g., talking to yourself, neglecting hygiene, bizarre actions)?\n\nI've noticed my thoughts are all over the place, and sometimes I find it hard to follow a conversation. I've also been neglecting basic things like showering and keeping my space tidy. It's like I get lost in my own mind.\n\nHave you experienced any clear manic symptoms like needing very little sleep with high energy, grandiosity, or risky impulsive behavior?\n\nNo, I haven’t had any of those manic symptoms like needing little sleep or feeling overly confident. It’s more of a constant feeling of agitation and confusion, rather than highs and lows. I mostly feel drained and overwhelmed by everything.\n\nHave you had any recent weight loss, night sweats, or other medical issues, and are you on any medications or supplements?\n\nI haven't experienced any weight loss or night sweats, and I’m not on any medications or supplements.

I haven't had trouble chewing, swallowing, or speaking, though.\n\nHave you noticed double vision that worsens as the day goes on?\n\nYes, I've experienced mild double vision, and it seems to get a bit worse as the day progresses. It's really unsettling, especially when I'm tired.\n\nHave you noticed that rest improves the eyelid droop or double vision, and do symptoms worsen after prolonged activity?\n\nRest does seem to help a bit with the eyelid droop and double vision.

Just a lot of itching and discomfort during intercourse.\n\nHave you noticed any unusual discharge, odor, or burning with urination?\n\nNo, I haven't had any unusual discharge or odor, and there's no burning when I urinate.

I know my right knee has been bothering me more lately, though.\n\nI haven't experienced any locking or catching in my knee, but there are times when it feels unstable and gives way a bit when I try to walk.\n\nI haven't noticed any swelling or pain in my Achilles, heels, or the bottom of my feet. My eyes haven't been red either.\n\nNo, I haven't noticed any specific swelling or tenderness right below the kneecap. The pain is more generalized around the sides and front of the knee.\n\nI haven’t had any hip or groin pain, but I do have persistent back pain that sometimes makes it harder to move around. It feels like the back pain contributes to my knee issues as well.\n\nYes, the swelling in my right knee tends to get worse after I've been active. It definitely feels better when I rest for a while.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Right_Knee_XRay_Weightbearing_AP_Lateral_Sunrise_View\n\nRESULTS: NORMAL READINGS.\n\nI don't do a lot of kneeling or putting direct pressure on my knee. My activities mainly involve walking around and trying to stay active, but that seems to aggravate the pain.\n\nGoing downstairs definitely makes the knee pain worse. Squatting is uncomfortable too, but it's mostly the stairs that aggravate it the most.\n\n", "llm_responses_config": {"max_output_tokens": 256, "reasoning": {"effort": "minimal"}, "text": {"verbosity": "low"}}, "llm_runtime_config": {"tries": 30, "timeout": 2.0, "clip_prompt": false, "max_prompt_len": 16384}}

I just feel overwhelmed and exhausted.\n\nYes, I've been feeling low energy and can't concentrate at all. It's frustrating, and some days I feel that sense of guilt lingering over me. It's been really tough to manage.\n\nI haven't had anything like this before. I’ve never been diagnosed with a mental health condition, but I’ve been feeling really off since I got back from deployment.\n\nYes, there were some tough experiences during deployment that I haven't really talked about. Sometimes, those memories come back, and it’s hard to shake them off. I try to avoid thinking about it, but it still lingers.\n\nI haven't had nightmares or flashbacks like that, but sometimes I do feel on edge and more alert than usual. I try to stay aware of my surroundings, but it can be exhausting.\n\nYes, they've been there most of the day, every day, for the past couple of months. It just feels like a heavy weight I can’t shake off.\n\nYes, I've noticed that I've been speaking more slowly than usual. Sometimes, I feel a bit restless, but mostly I just feel sluggish and heavy.\n\nYes, I've definitely felt a sense of hopelessness lately. Making decisions has become really difficult, even simple ones. It just feels overwhelming.\n\nNo, I haven’t experienced any of those manic symptoms. I’ve been feeling the opposite—just really drained and unmotivated. My thoughts feel slow, not racing.\n\nI haven't noticed any significant weight change, but I do feel like I'm eating less overall. No major medical issues that I know of, just feeling really off lately.\n\nI haven't had any thoughts of wanting to end my life, but I do feel really overwhelmed and sometimes wonder if things will ever get better. I just want to find a way to feel like myself again.\n\nYes, I do have difficulty concentrating, and sometimes my memory feels off. When I think about deployment events, I feel a bit detached, like it's hard to connect to those memories fully. It’s unsettling.\n\n", "llm_responses_config": {"max_output_tokens": 256, "reasoning": {"effort": "minimal"}, "text": {"verbosity": "low"}}, "llm_runtime_config": {"tries": 30, "timeout": 2.0, "clip_prompt": false, "max_prompt_len": 16384}}

I haven't tried arch support yet, but resting definitely helps alleviate the discomfort.\n\nHave you had any back-of-leg tightness or tenderness in the calf or along the plantar fascia when you press it?\n\nNo, I haven't felt any tightness or tenderness in the back of my leg or along the plantar fascia when I press it. It's mainly just the tingling and cramping in my foot and calf during exercise.\n\nHave you noticed numbness or tingling between the third and fourth toes, and does squeezing the forefoot worsen it?\n\nNo, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling between my third and fourth toes, and squeezing the forefoot doesn't seem to worsen the discomfort. The tingling is more focused on the arch of my right foot.\n\nHave you had low back issues or prior injuries to the foot/ankle?\n\nI haven't had any low back issues or injuries to my foot or ankle in the past.

They seem to feel normal during and after exercise.\n\nAny numbness or tingling in both feet symmetrically (stocking-glove pattern), or only the right?\n\nNo, the tingling is only in my right foot, not in both feet. I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling in a stocking-glove pattern.\n\nHave you noticed foot arch collapse or flatfoot on the right, and does standing on tiptoes reduce the tingling?\n\nI haven't noticed any collapse of the foot arch or flatfoot on the right. Standing on tiptoes doesn’t seem to reduce the tingling either; it feels pretty much the same.\n\nDo you feel the tingling worsen when you point your toes down or invert the foot (plantarflex/invert), or improve when you rest the foot in neutral?\n\nWhen I point my toes down or invert my foot, the tingling does seem to worsen. Resting the foot in a neutral position helps, but it doesn’t completely eliminate the discomfort.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I suspect tibial nerve irritation or compression around the ankle (tarsal tunnel area) despite a negative Tinel’s; the worsening with plantarflexion/inversion and relief in neutral support this. Do you have tingling or weakness reproduced by prolonged standing or after long walks on hard surfaces?\n\nI haven't noticed any tingling or weakness from prolonged standing or long walks on hard surfaces.

It's mainly just the tingling and cramping in my foot and calf during exercise.\n\nHave you noticed numbness or tingling between the third and fourth toes, and does squeezing the forefoot worsen it?\n\nNo, I haven't noticed any numbness or tingling between my third and fourth toes, and squeezing the forefoot doesn't seem to worsen the discomfort. The tingling is more focused on the arch of my right foot.\n\nHave you had low back issues or prior injuries to the foot/ankle?\n\nI haven't had any low back issues or injuries to my foot or ankle in the past. Everything seemed fine until these recent symptoms started.\n\nHave you noticed the pulses on the top of your right foot or behind the ankle feeling weaker than the left during or after exercise?\n\nI haven't noticed any difference in the pulses on the top of my right foot or behind the ankle compared to the left. They seem to feel normal during and after exercise.\n\nAny numbness or tingling in both feet symmetrically (stocking-glove pattern), or only the right?\n\nNo, the tingling is only in my right foot, not in both feet. I haven't experienced any numbness or tingling in a stocking-glove pattern.\n\nHave you noticed foot arch collapse or flatfoot on the right, and does standing on tiptoes reduce the tingling?\n\nI haven't noticed any collapse of the foot arch or flatfoot on the right. Standing on tiptoes doesn’t seem to reduce the tingling either; it feels pretty much the same.\n\nDo you feel the tingling worsen when you point your toes down or invert the foot (plantarflex/invert), or improve when you rest the foot in neutral?\n\nWhen I point my toes down or invert my foot, the tingling does seem to worsen. Resting the foot in a neutral position helps, but it doesn’t completely eliminate the discomfort.\n\nGiven your symptoms, I suspect tibial nerve irritation or compression around the ankle (tarsal tunnel area) despite a negative Tinel’s; the worsening with plantarflexion/inversion and relief in neutral support this. Do you have tingling or weakness reproduced by prolonged standing or after long walks on hard surfaces?\n\nI haven't noticed any tingling or weakness from prolonged standing or long walks on hard surfaces. The symptoms seem to be mainly related to exercise and elevation of my foot.\n\n", "measurement_hist": "It's mostly in the arch of my right foot, but sometimes I feel it radiating towards the toes.\n\nNo, the tingling doesn't worsen at night, and dangling my foot off the bed doesn’t seem to help much. It’s mainly an issue during the day, especially when I exercise.\n\nI don't notice any numbness or burning, but there is some weakness when I try to flex my toes. Tapping behind my inner ankle doesn't cause any shooting pain either.\n\nNo, I don't have any heel pain in the morning or after resting. The discomfort is mostly in the arch and sole of my right foot when I elevate it.\n\nYes, I do experience cramping in my right calf when I walk, especially when using the incline on the treadmill. It gets better after I take a break and rest for a few minutes.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Ankle_Brachial_Index (ABI)\n\nRESULTS: NORMAL READINGS\n\nYes, my symptoms do improve when I stop exercising and rest for a few minutes. I don't experience any back pain radiating down my leg, though.\n\nI haven't noticed any color changes or coolness in my right foot during or after exercise. The capillary refill seems normal as well; it returns to normal quick.\n\nI don't have any swelling or tenderness behind my knee or inner ankle.

It feels really tight and sharp.\n\nHow long has the pain lasted, and what were you doing when it started?\n\nIt started about an hour ago while I was sitting quietly at home. It just came on suddenly and has been consistent since then.\n\nDo you have shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or lightheadedness?\n\nI do feel a bit short of breath, and I’ve had some sweating. No nausea or lightheadedness, though.\n\nDo you have any risk factors—high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, or family history of heart disease?\n\nI don’t have any of those risk factors, and I’ve never had any major health issues before. My family history is also pretty clear.\n\nHave you noticed any chest tenderness when pressing on the area or pain that worsens with deep breaths or movement?\n\nI haven't noticed any tenderness when I press on my chest, but taking deep breaths does make the pain feel worse. Moving around also increases the discomfort a little.\n\nDoes the pain change with body position (better leaning forward, worse lying flat)?\n\nI haven’t really tried changing positions, but I feel like leaning forward might help a little. Lying back doesn’t feel comfortable at all.\n\nRESULTS: ECG findings show no significant findings.\n\nAny recent viral illness, sore throat, or fever before the pain began?\n\nI haven't had any recent viral illness, sore throat, or fever.

It's really just been this chest pain and the emotional turmoil from losing my husband.\n\nHave you had recent trauma or heavy lifting, or is the pain reproducible with pressing on the chest now?\n\nI haven’t had any recent trauma or heavy lifting, and pressing on my chest still doesn’t cause any pain. It’s just that tight, sharp feeling that’s really distressing.\n\nDoes the pain improve when you sit leaning forward and worsen when lying flat?\n\nIt does seem to feel a little better when I lean forward, but lying flat is definitely uncomfortable and makes the pain worse.\n\nAny recent vaccinations or autoimmune conditions?\n\nI haven’t had any recent vaccinations, and I don’t have any autoimmune conditions that I know of. It's really mostly been this overwhelming stress.\n\nAny fever or pleuritic chest pain with a pericardial friction rub on exam?\n\nI haven't had any fever, and I don't feel any pleuritic chest pain. I also haven’t noticed a friction rub during the exam.\n\nDo you have chest pain when swallowing or recent heartburn/acid reflux?\n\nI haven't had any chest pain when swallowing, and I don't usually deal with heartburn or acid reflux.

It’s really distressing.\n\nHave you had symptoms like hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, trouble concentrating, or irritability most days?\n\nYes, I feel like I'm always on high alert, and I get startled really easily. It's hard to concentrate on anything, and I find myself getting irritable over small things.\n\nHave you used alcohol or substances to cope, or had any recent head injuries?\n\nI haven’t used alcohol or substances to cope, but I did bump my head a few weeks ago during some training. I didn't think much of it at the time.\n\nHave you had headaches, dizziness, nausea, confusion, or memory problems since that head bump?\n\nI haven't really had any headaches, dizziness, or nausea since the bump. I feel a bit foggy at times, though, like my memory isn’t as sharp as it used to be. It's more the stress and anxiety that's been overwhelming.\n\nHave you noticed depressed mood most days, changes in appetite, or feelings of guilt or worthlessness?\n\nI’ve definitely been feeling down most days, and I often experience guilt about things that happened during my deployment. My appetite has changed a bit, but it’s mostly the guilt and sadness that weigh on me.\n\nHave you had any panic attacks or dissociative episodes where you feel detached from reality?\n\nI haven't had full-blown panic attacks, but there are times when I feel really detached from everything, like I'm watching it all from a distance. It’s unsettling, and I just want to escape those moments.\n\nHave these symptoms started within 6 months of the traumatic events, and did they begin soon after returning from deployment?\n\nYes, these symptoms started about three months after I returned from deployment, so it's definitely within that timeframe. It all began around seven weeks ago when things started to get overwhelming for me.\n\nHave you noticed persistent negative beliefs about yourself or the world, or excessive blame related to the trauma?\n\nI've been struggling with negative thoughts about myself, feeling like I didn't do enough during my time in Iraq. I keep thinking that I'm a burden to those around me, and it's hard to shake that feeling. It makes everything feel heavier.\n\nHave you had any current or past suicidal thoughts, plans, or self-harm behaviors, even fleeting?\n\nI haven't had any suicidal thoughts or plans, but there are moments when I feel really overwhelmed and just wish I could escape everything. It's more about feeling trapped than wanting to harm myself.\n\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, or anxiety before this deployment?\n\nI’ve never been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, or anxiety before this deployment. I’ve always been able to handle stress pretty well, but this feels different, like I can’t shake it off.\n\nHave you been avoiding thoughts, feelings, or conversations about the trauma, and avoiding activities or people that remind you of it?\n\nYes, I've been trying really hard to avoid thinking or talking about my experiences in Iraq. I also find myself avoiding friends and activities that remind me of that time, just to keep myself from feeling overwhelmed. It’s like I’m isolating myself to feel safer.\n\nHave you noticed problems with sleep duration or quality beyond nightmares, like difficulty falling or staying asleep?\n\nI've been having a lot of trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Even when I do manage to sleep, it doesn’t feel restful because I keep waking up from those upsetting dreams. I just feel exhausted all the time.\n\nHave you had any medical conditions, medications, or thyroid issues that could affect mood or sleep?\n\nI haven't had any medical conditions or thyroid issues before. I’m not on any medications either; this is all pretty new for me.\n\nHave you noticed that these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in daily functioning across work, social life, or self-care?\n\nAbsolutely, these symptoms have taken a toll on my daily life. I struggle to focus at work, and it’s hard to maintain relationships with friends and family. Self-care feels like a challenge when I’m feeling overwhelmed all the time.\n\nREQUEST TEST: PHQ-9 Questionnaire\n\nRESULTS: NON-applicable for this case.This is the final question.

I just feel more comfortable in my own space, away from others.\n\nDo you find close relationships emotionally taxing or prefer not to have them at all, including with family?\n\nI definitely prefer not to have close relationships. Even with my family, I feel like it’s easier to just keep my distance. It's less overwhelming that way.\n\nDo you experience strong anxiety or fear in social situations, or is it more a lack of desire for social contact?\n\nI wouldn’t say I feel anxious.

It’s more like I don’t really feel the need for those emotions in my life.\n\nDo you function well in work or school and daily self-care despite preferring solitude?\n\nI think I manage okay at school and take care of myself, but I just do the bare minimum. I keep up with my studies, but I don’t really engage with others.\n\nDo you have a history of trauma, bullying, or autism spectrum traits (e.g., lifelong social difficulties, restricted interests)?\n\nI haven’t experienced any trauma or bullying, and I wouldn’t say I’ve had lifelong social difficulties. I just feel comfortable being on my own and don’t see a need for more social interaction.\n\nDo you feel indifferent to praise or criticism and prefer solitary activities over group ones most of the time?\n\nYeah, I don't really feel much about praise or criticism. I usually choose solitary activities, like reading, over anything in a group. It just feels easier that way.\n\nDo you have few or no close friends and feel detached even from first-degree relatives?\n\nI have no close friends and I do feel pretty detached from my family. It just seems simpler to keep things that way.\n\nHave these patterns started before age 25 and remained stable over time?\n\nI think these patterns started well before I turned 16, but they've definitely become more pronounced over the last two years. It feels like my preferences have remained the same throughout.\n\nHave these traits caused clinically significant distress or impairment, or are you largely content with this lifestyle?\n\nI wouldn't say it's caused me distress. I'm mostly content just doing my own thing and being alone. It’s just the way I prefer to live these days.\n\nHave you ever had periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, or impulsive behavior lasting days?\n\nNo, I haven’t had any periods like that. My mood has been pretty steady, and I don’t generally feel the need to do anything impulsive. I just stick to my routine.\n\nHave others reported you seem emotionally cold or aloof, and do you rarely desire or enjoy sexual experiences?\n\nI suppose some people have mentioned that I seem distant or cold, but I don't really notice it myself. As for sexual experiences, I don’t have any desire for them; it just doesn’t interest me.\n\nDo you use substances (alcohol, cannabis, other drugs) that affect your social interest?\n\nI don’t use any substances at all. I’ve never felt the need for them; I just prefer to keep to myself.\n\nDo you have a history of conduct problems, odd behaviors, or cognitive difficulties that affect daily functioning?\n\nNo, I don’t have any history of conduct problems or odd behaviors. I function pretty normally in daily life; it’s just that I prefer to do things on my own.\n\nDo you feel little pleasure from most activities overall, or is it mainly social contact you don’t desire?\n\nI mainly lack desire for social contact. I still find some enjoyment in activities like reading, but overall, I just prefer my own company.\n\nDo you want help changing this, or are you satisfied living this way?\n\nI don’t really feel the need for change. I’m comfortable with how things are, and I prefer to keep it that way for now.This is the final question.

It’s more like I don’t care to engage, rather than feeling down.\n\nDo you have unusual beliefs, hear or see things others don’t, or feel people are watching you?\n\nNo, I don't have any unusual beliefs or experiences like that. I just feel more comfortable in my own space, away from others.\n\nDo you find close relationships emotionally taxing or prefer not to have them at all, including with family?\n\nI definitely prefer not to have close relationships. Even with my family, I feel like it’s easier to just keep my distance. It's less overwhelming that way.\n\nDo you experience strong anxiety or fear in social situations, or is it more a lack of desire for social contact?\n\nI wouldn’t say I feel anxious. It’s more like I just don’t have the desire to be around people. I find it easier to be by myself.\n\nDo you have a limited range of emotions and rarely feel strong joy, anger, or warmth toward others?\n\nI wouldn’t say I have a limited range of emotions, but I definitely don’t feel strong connections or warmth towards others. It’s more like I don’t really feel the need for those emotions in my life.\n\nDo you function well in work or school and daily self-care despite preferring solitude?\n\nI think I manage okay at school and take care of myself, but I just do the bare minimum. I keep up with my studies, but I don’t really engage with others.\n\nDo you have a history of trauma, bullying, or autism spectrum traits (e.g., lifelong social difficulties, restricted interests)?\n\nI haven’t experienced any trauma or bullying, and I wouldn’t say I’ve had lifelong social difficulties. I just feel comfortable being on my own and don’t see a need for more social interaction.\n\nDo you feel indifferent to praise or criticism and prefer solitary activities over group ones most of the time?\n\nYeah, I don't really feel much about praise or criticism. I usually choose solitary activities, like reading, over anything in a group. It just feels easier that way.\n\nDo you have few or no close friends and feel detached even from first-degree relatives?\n\nI have no close friends and I do feel pretty detached from my family. It just seems simpler to keep things that way.\n\nHave these patterns started before age 25 and remained stable over time?\n\nI think these patterns started well before I turned 16, but they've definitely become more pronounced over the last two years. It feels like my preferences have remained the same throughout.\n\nHave these traits caused clinically significant distress or impairment, or are you largely content with this lifestyle?\n\nI wouldn't say it's caused me distress. I'm mostly content just doing my own thing and being alone. It’s just the way I prefer to live these days.\n\nHave you ever had periods of elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, or impulsive behavior lasting days?\n\nNo, I haven’t had any periods like that. My mood has been pretty steady, and I don’t generally feel the need to do anything impulsive. I just stick to my routine.\n\nHave others reported you seem emotionally cold or aloof, and do you rarely desire or enjoy sexual experiences?\n\nI suppose some people have mentioned that I seem distant or cold, but I don't really notice it myself. As for sexual experiences, I don’t have any desire for them; it just doesn’t interest me.\n\nDo you use substances (alcohol, cannabis, other drugs) that affect your social interest?\n\nI don’t use any substances at all. I’ve never felt the need for them; I just prefer to keep to myself.\n\nDo you have a history of conduct problems, odd behaviors, or cognitive difficulties that affect daily functioning?\n\nNo, I don’t have any history of conduct problems or odd behaviors. I function pretty normally in daily life; it’s just that I prefer to do things on my own.\n\nDo you feel little pleasure from most activities overall, or is it mainly social contact you don’t desire?\n\nI mainly lack desire for social contact. I still find some enjoyment in activities like reading, but overall, I just prefer my own company.\n\nDo you want help changing this, or are you satisfied living this way?\n\nI don’t really feel the need for change. I’m comfortable with how things are, and I prefer to keep it that way for now.\n\n", "measurement_hist": "It started about two years ago, and it’s been getting worse since then.
