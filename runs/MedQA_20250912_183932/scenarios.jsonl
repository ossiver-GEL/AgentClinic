I also find it hard to climb stairs, and my arms feel weak when I try to do simple tasks like brushing my hair. They get better if I rest for a bit.\n\nHave you noticed any difficulty swallowing or speaking?\n\nI haven't had any trouble swallowing or speaking, but my eyes do feel really tired, especially after using the computer for a while.\n\nHave you experienced any facial weakness or changes in your smile?\n\nI haven't noticed any facial weakness or changes in my smile, but I do feel a bit of heaviness around my eyes sometimes.\n\nHave you been experiencing any fatigue or muscle weakness throughout the day?\n\nYes, I've definitely been feeling more fatigued than usual, especially in my arms and legs. The muscle weakness tends to get worse with activity, but it improves a lot after I rest.\n\nHave you noticed any changes in your reflexes or coordination?\n\nI haven't really noticed any changes in my reflexes or coordination, but I do feel a bit clumsier sometimes, especially when I'm tired. It can be harder to grip things or hold onto items.\n\nHave you experienced any episodes of drooping eyelids or any other visual disturbances?\n\nI haven't had any drooping eyelids, but sometimes my vision gets blurry or I see double, especially after focusing for a while. It can be quite frustrating when I try to concentrate on my work.\n\nHave you had any recent illnesses or infections?\n\nI haven't had any recent illnesses or infections. I feel pretty healthy otherwise, just dealing with these ongoing symptoms.\n\nHave you had any muscle cramps or stiffness?\n\nI haven't experienced any muscle cramps or stiffness, but my muscles do feel weaker after I've been active. It’s mostly just that heaviness and fatigue.\n\nHave you had any family history of autoimmune diseases or muscle disorders?\n\nI don’t have any family history of autoimmune diseases or muscle disorders that I’m aware of. My family's pretty healthy overall.\n\nHave you noticed if these symptoms change with heat or cold?\n\nI've noticed that my symptoms tend to get worse in the heat. For example, when I go outside on warmer days, my double vision and fatigue seem to increase. Cold doesn't seem to have much of an effect, though.\n\nREQUEST TEST: Antibody_Test_for_Ach receptors\n\nRESULTS: Acetylcholine_Receptor_Antibodies: Present (elevated)\n\nDIAGNOSIS READY: Myasthenia Gravis\n\n", "patient_hist": "What other symptoms have you been experiencing?\n\nI've been having double vision, especially when I'm tired.
