It's mainly the double vision and weakness that concern me.\n\nHave you experienced any drooping of the eyelids?\n\nI haven't noticed any drooping of my eyelids. It's primarily the double vision and weakness that's bothering me.\n\nHave you experienced any recent infections or illnesses?\n\nNo, I haven't had any recent infections or illnesses. I feel generally well aside from the symptoms I've mentioned.\n\nHave you experienced any fatigue or muscle weakness that improves with rest?\n\nYes, I've definitely experienced muscle weakness that improves quite a bit after resting. It feels like I can regain my strength after a little break.\n\nHave you noticed any weakness in your facial muscles?\n\nI haven't noticed any weakness in my facial muscles.
