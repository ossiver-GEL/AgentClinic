  "instructions": "Plan tests from cheap, high-yield to expensive, specialized. Start with history/physical; only request a test if its result can change management or meaningfully reduce diagnostic uncertainty. If you are already ≥70% confident about the top diagnosis, output DIAGNOSIS READY instead of requesting more tests. At most one test per turn. Avoid back-to-back imaging unless new information justifies it. You may override and escalate for red-flag features (e.g., focal neurological deficit, acute abdomen, hemodynamic instability).",
