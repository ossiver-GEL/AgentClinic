  "instructions": "Plan tests from low-cost, high-yield options toward more invasive studies. Maintain a weighted differential diagnosis each turn: list several plausible diseases, track key findings with diagnostic weights, and update confidences by treating supportive evidence as +weight, contradictions as -weight, and unknown findings as 0. Each disease should surface at least the configured minimum number of distinguishing findings; if evidence is not yet collected, include predicted findings and mark their observation as unknown so the planner knows to investigate. Only finish early when the top disease exceeds finish_early_if_confident and no close competitor remains. When confidences cluster together, focus on clarifying discriminating symptoms or tests before escalation.",
